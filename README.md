#Collaborative Git project: A simple website

##Project overview
This is a group 10 project where we collaboratively develop a simple website using Git and Github.

The application consists of:
-One landing page (index.html, created by the group leader)
-Nine additional HTML pages each created by a different group member
-All pages are linked from the landing page

##Group members
-Belva (leader): Landing page 
-Eliud: About Us
-: Gallery
-Swalha: Services
-Khadija: Pricing
-Rebecca: Our Team
-Chrispin: FAQs
-Catherine: Reviews
-Jolyine: Contact Us
-Edgar: Get Started

##Repo Setup
-The repo is public
-The main branch is MASTER
-All members clone the same repo (link already sent in the group)

##Poject structure
|-index.html
  |-about.html
  |-gallery.html
  |-services.html
  |-pricing.html
  |-team.html
  |-faqs.html
  |-reviews.html
  |-contact.html
  |-get_started.html
|-swe1.css  #a shared CSS file
|-all_images  #a shared folder for all our images (if any). Don't keep images separately, keep them in here after cloning the repo and also don't use too many images.

##Instructions for group members
-Clone the repo
-Create your OWN branch ie git checkout -b member_name
-Create only one HTML file eg. about.html. If there are images add them to the shared folder and for styling add your styles in the shared CSS file.
-Commit  only your own work eg git add team.html git commit -m"Add team.html page"
-Push your branch to the repo, don't commit directly to the MASTER branch. git push origin your-branch-name
-DO NOT MODIFY OTHER MEMBERS' HTML FILES.
-USE UNIQUE CLASS NAMES FOR YOUR SECTION. I RECOMMEND TO PREFIX THE PAGE NAME BEFORE THE CLASS TO AVOID CONFLICTS eg.
.pricing-grid
.gallery-grid  etc.
